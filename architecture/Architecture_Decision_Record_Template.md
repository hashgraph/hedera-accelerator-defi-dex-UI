**Proposed** - The decision needs to be reviewed by the Engineering team before implementation can begin.

**Accepted** - The Engineering team has reviewed the proposal, submitted feedback, and has signed off on moving forward with the proposed decision. Implementation can begin once a decision is accepted.

**Rejected** - The Engineering team found that the proposed decision does not solve the issue at hand, introduces too many drawbacks, or can be resolved with an alternative solution.

**Deprecated** - The document no longer reflects the state of the application architecture. The document should remain for historical context.

**Superseded** - The decision has been replaced. The document should remain as context that supports the superseding decision.
